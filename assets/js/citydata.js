Jijabai and Shahaji's son, Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire, was born at the fort of Shivneri, about 90 km from Pune. After the destruction of the town in raids by the Adil Shahi dynasty in 1630 and again between 1636 and 1647, Dadoji Konddeo oversaw the reconstruction of the town. The Lal Mahal was commissioned in 1631 and construction was completed in 1640 AD. Shivaji spent his young years at the Lal Mahal. Jijabai is said to have commissioned the building of the Kasba Ganapati temple. The Ganesha idol consecrated at this temple has been regarded as the presiding deity (Gramadevata) of the city. From 1703 to 1705, towards the end of the 27-year-long Mughal–Maratha Wars, the village was occupied by Aurangzeb and its name was changed temporarily to Muhiyabad.This name was abandoned and reverted back to its original name soon after Aurangzib's death.",
